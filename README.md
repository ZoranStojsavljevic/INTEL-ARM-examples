### INTEL-ARM-miscellaneous-titbits

This repository reflects some very interesting miniatures, which the author found scattered
on the net while doing some very complex projects over the long time span. The author have
collected very many (around several hundred) of such in the private repos and on PC
scattered around, so author decided to expose some of the most interesting to other people
(trying to enhance examples by writing detailed documentation, especially for INTEL stuff)
to learn and maybe develop more examples based upon presented specimens.

Author encourages everybody to read these examples and post some interesting ones on their
own, or point to them to me (via issues) as well, even to expose some of them using the
upstream git pull requests to this repo.

Includes the following packages:

INTEL/			INTELTOOL - Provides information about the Intel CPU/chipset hardware
			configuration.

ARM/armv7-cortex-A/	MDEVX - simple command-line C tool used to read/write to hardware
			locations in a 32 bit armv7 A5, A8, A9, A12, A15 MMU based silicons.
			It is a standalone tool.
