### INTEL-ARM-examples

This repository reflects some very interesting tools/miniatures, which the author either
developed on his own, or did the improvements to some existing, or found some of them
scattered over the net, while doing some complex projects over the long time span.

The author have collected very many (around several hundred) of such in the private repos
and on PC scattered around, so author decided to expose some of the most interesting to
other people (trying to enhance examples by writing detailed documentation, especially
for INTEL CORE silicons) to learn and maybe develop more intriguing apps based upon the
presented specimens.

Author encourages everybody to read these examples and post some interesting ones on
their own, or point to them to me (via issues) as well, even to expose some of them
using the upstream git pull requests to this repo.
