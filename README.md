### INTEL-ARM-miscellaneous-titbits

This repository reflects some very interesting miniatures, which the author found scattered
on the net while doing some very complex projects over the long time span. The author have
collected very many (around several hundred) of such in the private repos and on PC
scattered around, so author decided to expose some of the most interesting to other people
(trying to enhance examples by writing detailed documentation, especially for INTEL stuff)
to learn and maybe develop more examples based upon presented specimens.

Author encourages everybody to read these examples and post some interesting ones on their
own, or point to them to me (via issues) as well, even to expose some of them using the
upstream git pull requests to this repo.

This repo is supposed to be a live repo from now on...

Thank you for understanding,
Zoran
